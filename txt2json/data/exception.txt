Tools for teachers

This area focuses on developing fundamental communication skills through interaction with a supporting adult. The aim is to create enjoyable and meaningful interactions whereby the adult ‘tunes in’ and responds to the learner in order to develop their enjoyment of the interaction and to provide them with reasons and opportunities to communicate. This developing understanding of the social nature of communication underpins learning in this area.
